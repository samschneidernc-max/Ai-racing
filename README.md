This is entirely generated by ChatGPT, so I don't expect it to be the best. Please let me know if there's anything I can change to improve it, as I'm not familiar with coding. 

NeuroRacer uses simple neural network drivers. Each car takes in five distance sensors plus its speed as inputs and produces steering and throttle as outputs.
The driving behavior improves through a genetic algorithm that relies on tournament selection, elitism, and mutation. Fitness is calculated by checkpoints passed, overall progress, and survival time.
Cars must clear checkpoints to be rewarded. Crossing a gate backwards is heavily punished, which prevents vehicles from spinning in circles to gain progress unfairly.
The track is drawn with Canvas in ChatGPT. The best car displays its sensor rays, and checkpoints are shown faintly on the track with upcoming gates highlighted in orange.
Controls are straightforward. Press the spacebar to pause or run the simulation. Press N to force the next generation, and press R to reset the population.
